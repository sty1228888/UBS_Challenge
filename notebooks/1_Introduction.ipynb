    "区间累计计息的结构化票据 (Range Accrual Note) 是一种挂钩利率的衍生金融产品，兼具传统的固定收益产品和金融衍生工具的特点。投资者在投资此类产品时，往往对互换利率 (例如5年期互换利率) 的走势有所预期，并将票息收益与此挂钩。而此类产品的结构往往被设计成具有上、下限的特征，从而为投资者的收益提供一定程度上的保护。"

    "Range Accrual Note is an interest rate-linked derivative financial product that combines the characteristics of traditional fixed income products and financial derivatives. When investors invest in such products, they often have expectations for the trend of the swap rate (such as the 5-year swap rate) and link the coupon income to this. The structure of such products is often designed to have upper and lower limits, thereby providing a certain degree of protection for investors' returns."
